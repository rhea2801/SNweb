          SN/IG hall of residence is one of the oldest hall in the Institute.
          For decades, the Hall has been the home away from home for both
          undergraduate and postgraduate women students. Despite the fewer
          number of its residents, the SN/IG Hall has carved its own niche in
          both academics and in various socio-cultural and sports events and
          competitions organized by the students’ Gymkhana. The Hall is also
          actively involved in all major students’ events such as the Spring
          Fest, Kshitij etc. In addition to representing IIT Kharagpur in
          various teams in Inter-IIT competitions, its residents have also
          consistently held offices at Technology Students’ Gymkhana.
